# Pushd!
## What's this?
Pushd is a Multiplayer game I made in January of 2019.
It's a "competitive" turn-based puzzle game. Each player is assigned a color and a cube of that color.

Players get a new cube at their initial spawn point every few turns or when the player has no cubes left.
Whoever's turn it is, can move in 4 directions. They move ALL their cubes towards that direction, *pushing* them. If a cube falls of the level, they lose a life. If their life reaches 0, they are eliminated.

The game's code since 2019 has been **unchanged.** The language is still in Hungarian, and there might be some oversights in some special cases.

There's a tutorial in the game when you play for the first time (also explained in Hungarian)

Audio is not in uploaded to the repo due to licensing issues, but it's available in the executable.

## Download?
There's a Builds folder in this repo, that has an executable.
